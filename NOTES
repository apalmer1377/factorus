Bugs
----
- FRollback doesn't work properly if quickfix file gets opened (FIXED 07-11-2017)

Tasks
-----
- Create Rebuild command to validate code changes (ant/maven builds) (DONE 07-12-2017, rudimentary but functional)
- Make all methods atomic--if an error is thrown or the function is interrupted, roll back the changes
- Provide list of all files/ all changes made after a rename
    * Java: 07-10-2017
    * Python: 07-10-2017
- Addendum to above: provide list of all changes NOT made after a rename (did we miss anything)
    * Java: 07-11-2017
    * Python: 07-11-2017
- Further addendum: Allow both changes and unchanges to be seen (I know that isn't a word)
    * Java: 07-12-2017
    * Python: 07-12-2017
- Manual extraction (methods, types, etc.)
- Find repeated/duplicate code
- Add default argument to function with added parameter

Bugs
----
- When breaking up lines in extractMethod, function hangs when line length == g:factorus_line_length (FIXED 07-09-2017)
- When other declarations were before return declaration, extractMethod incorrectly added declaration into conditional block (FIXED 07-10-2017)
- End message doesn't display when running FRollback from other tab (FIXED 07-10-2017)
- Multiple declarations on the same line (int i,j) don't get noticed (FIXED 07-11-2017)
- When constructed type contains question mark (Foo<? extends Bar>), declarations don't get noticed (FIXED 07-11-2017)
- extractMethod still sometimes not noticing conditionals (FIXED 07-11-2017)
- When subclass declaration extends multiple lines, subclass doesn't get noticed (FIXED 07-12-2017, works but slows down execution a lot)
- Classes with the same name in the same package should be considered the same entity (FIXED 07-12-2017)

Tasks
-----
- Speed up renameMethod (again) (Down to normal speeds 07-12-2017)
- Speed up Rollback for renaming (DONE 07-12-2017)

Bugs
----
- Some changes can't be seen in rename, and so can be overwritten or ignored (FIXED 07-12-2017)

Tasks
-----
- Rollback function--when things don't go as expected, provide a rollback to undo the previous action (DONE 07-10-2017)
- extractMethod function (PRELIM 07-11-2017)
- make renaming better (currently just a universal find/replace)
