Bugs
----
- When breaking up lines in extractMethod, function hangs when line length == g:factorus_line_length (FIXED 07-09-2017)
- When other declarations were before return declaration, extractMethod incorrectly added declaration into conditional block (FIXED 07-10-2017)
- End message doesn't display when running FRollback from other tab (FIXED 07-10-2017)

Tasks
-----
- Make all methods atomic--if an error is thrown or the function is interrupted, roll back the changes
- Provide list of all files/ all changes made after a rename (DONE 07-10-2017)
