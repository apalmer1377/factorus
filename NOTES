Bugs
----
- Encapsulation doesn't work if first line of file is defining the class (Fixed 3/09/2019)
- renameClass doesn't do anything if not part of a package (Fixed 3/09/2019)
- Rollback of encapsulation stopped working (Fixed 3/09/2019)
- Rolling back a manually extracted function doesn't work (Fixed 3/09/2019)
- renameMethod has quickfix issues when only changing one file, which also breaks rolling back (Fixed 3/10/2019)

-rename finds declaration within comments, which it shouldn't be recognizing.
-update_file updates variable names that are part of different variables, which it shouldn't do.

Tasks
-----
