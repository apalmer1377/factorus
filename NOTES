Bugs
----
- FRenameField doesn't work with multiple declarations on the same line (FIXED?)
- strange "find" error occasionally with large codebases or frequent use of system('find') (FIXED 2017-07-24)
- A lot of issues with extractMethod (frequently extracts invalid code snippets, lines from mismatched blocks, etc.)
    Java: Testing 2017-07-24, some fixed 2017-07-26
    C: Testing 2017-07-25, some fixed 2017-07-26
    Python: N/A

    Java: 2017-07-24
    Python: 2017-07-24
    C: 2017-07-24
- Find repeated/duplicate code
+ Add default argument to function with added parameter

Bugs
----
- getSubClasses sometimes causes unwanted tabs to stay open, and wanted tabs to close (FIXED 2017-07-26)
- getSubClasses not always getting correct class (nested class implements superclasses, but gets marked as outer level instead of inner level) (TESTING 2017-07-27)

- make renaming better (currently just a universal find/replace) (unrealistic?)

Bugs
----
- Typedefs not noticed in renameField (FIXED 2017-07-24)
+ Structs defined within structs not properly identified in renameField (FIXED 2017-07-26)
- Arrays of structs not identified in renameField (FIXED 2017-07-24)
- Method declarations without implementation not noticed as tags (FIXED 2017-07-24)
- Struct definition with no name shouldn't be noticed as a tag (FIXED 2017-07-26)
- renameType doesn't search all header files (header files don't need to include base file) (FIXED 2017-07-27)
- rollbackRename sometimes throws 'unable to open swap file' error

Tasks
-----
- Speed up renameField (specifically in the context of renaming a struct field)

- Add functionality for C++
