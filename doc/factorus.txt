1. Intro                                                      *factorus-intro*

Factorus is a lightweight Vim plugin for automated refactoring.  It's 
written entirely in Vimscript, so there is no need for any external packages.
However, Factorus does make use of system commands find, grep, sort, rm, cat,
xargs, and ls.

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                      *factorus-usage*

Factorus provides numerous functions for refactoring your code. The current
functions are roughly grouped into three categories: extraction, insertion,
and modification. Factorus also provides |:FRollback|, for reverting unwanted
changes, and |:FRebuild|, for rebuilding the project and validating changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Extraction                                              *factorus-extract*

:FExtractMethod                                              *:FExtractMethod*
    Extracts a section of relatively isolated statements into a new method.
    The name of the method defaults to "newFactorusMethod", but this can be
    changed if desired (see |g:factorus_default_method|).

    NOTE: Though the function tries to be conservative in how it extracts 
    the new method, it performs no checks to make sure the resulting 
    code runs in the same way; therefore, it is hightly suggested that you 
    review the changes made before committing them.

:FMExtractMethod [{new_name}]
    Extracts the visually selected text into a new method, which is then
    inserted directly below the current method. The return type and
    arguments of the new method are automatically determined, and the method
    name is either {new_name}, or |g:factorus_method_name| if {new_name} is
    not provided.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Insertion                                                *factorus-insert*

:FAddParam {new_name} {other} [{default}]                         *:FAddParam*
    Adds a new parameter with name {new_name} to 
    the function definition. The use of {other} depends on what language
    is being used:
        
        in Java/C, {other} is mandatory, and represents the type of the new
        parameter. The argument will be added to the end of the argument
        list.

        in Python, {other} is optional, and represents the default argument
        for the parameter.  If {other} is included, the argument will be
        added to the end of the argument list; otherwise, it will be added
        to the end.

    If working in Java or C, and if |g:factorus_add_default| == 1, then the
    optional {default} argument provides a default argument for external
    function calls.  If |g:factorus_add_default| == 1, but {default} is not
    supplied, then the default argument is 'null'.

:FEncapsulate [{name}]                                         *:FEncapsulate*
    Creates getter and setter methods for the current variable, and sets 
    the variable scope to private. If the optional {name} argument is given,
    then that name is used in the getter and setter methods; otherwise, the
    variable name is used.

    For example, say you have a variable like this:
>
        public String mName;
<

    If you run 
>
        :FEncapsulate
<

    the resulting getter-setter pair will look like this:
>
        public String getMName() {
            return mName;
        }

        public void setMName(String mName) {
            this.mName = mName;
        }
<

    However, if you run 
>
        :FEncapsulate name
<

        the getter-setter pair will look like this:
>
        public String getName() {
            return mName;
        }

        public void setName(String mName) {
            this.mName = mName;
        }
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Modification                                             *factorus-modify*

:FRenameArg {new_name}                                           *:FRenameArg*
    Renames the argument under the cursor to {new_name}.

:FRenameClass {new_name}                                       *:FRenameClass* 
    Renames the current class to {new_name}.

:FRenameField {new_name}                                       *:FRenameField*
    Renames the current variable to {new_name}. This function provides 
    multiple different functionalities:
        - Rename a variable within a function
        - Rename a class/struct field, and all of its instances
        - Rename a static variable, and all occurrences
        - Rename an enum field, and all occurences

:FRenameMethod {new_name}                                     *:FRenameMethod*
    Renames the current method to {new_name}.  

(For C/C++ Only)

:FRenameType {new_name}                                         *:FRenameType* 
    Renames the current struct/enum to {new_name}.

:FRenameMacro {new_name}                                       *:FRenameMacro*
    Renames the macro defined on the current line to {new_name}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4 Miscellaneous                                              *factorus-misc*

:Factorus                                                          *:Factorus*
    Displays the current version of Factorus.

:FRollback                                                        *:FRollback*
    Reverts the changes made by the latest Factorus command (other than the
    commands listed in |factorus_misc|). For instance, if you most recently
    renamed a class Foo using the command
>
        :FRenameClass Bar
<
    and would like to change back, simply run
>
        :FRollback
<
    to set everything back to normal.  This only works for the most recent
    command, so changes made before then are permanent.

    If a command throws an error or is interrupted, changes are rolled
    back automatically.

    NOTE: In some projects, running a rename command causes git to show some
    files as changed, with the only change being a newline character at the
    end. This is not rolled back by |:FRollback|, since it is a side effect
    of editing in Vim as opposed to other text editors. However, these
    changes make no functional difference to the file.

:FRebuild [{build_task}]                                           *:FRebuild*
    Rebuilds the current project, and displays the build output in a separate
    window. If {build_task} is given, the projects is built according to that 
    task; otherwise, |g:factorus_build_task| is used.

    Default build-file names are available for make,ant,gradle, maven, and
    rake; for example, if |g:factorus_build_program| == 'make', but 
    |g:factorus_build_file| is not set, then the function will look for a
    file called 'Makefile'.
   
    NOTE: When searching for a build file, |:FRebuild| will first search the
    project root directory, then in all subdirectories, and will use the first
    build file it finds. If there are multiple build files in your project, 
    you may want to specify which file to use with |g:factorus:build_file|.

==============================================================================
3. Configuration                                          *factorus-configure*


                                                      *g:factorus_project_dir*
g:factorus_project_dir~
Default: ''

The project directory used to search for files when updating class or method
names.  If empty, the current git root directory is used.  This option is 
helpful when you have multiple projects that reference each other.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_project_dir = '/home/factorus/workspace' 
<

                                              *g:factorus_min_extracted_lines*
g:factorus_min_extracted_lines~
Default: 3

The minimum number of lines required for a method to be extracted by
|:FExtractMethod|.  If the number of lines found is less than this number,
nothing is done.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_min_extracted_lines = 5
<

                                                   *g:factorus_method_name*
g:factorus_method_name~
Default: 'newFactorusMethod'

The default name for a new method created by |:FExtractMethod| and
|:FManualExtract|.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_method_name = 'genericJavaFunction'
<

                                                    *g:factorus_ignored_files*
g:factorus_ignored_files~
Default: ['tags','cscope.out']

These files are ignored when updating class or method names.  Anything custom-
defined will be appended to the array instead of replacing it; i.e., if you 
set it to ['.*.swp'] in your vimrc file, the ignored files will be
['tags','cscope.out','.*.swp'].

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_ignored_files = ['*.xml','*.jsp','*.jar'] 
<

                                                     *g:factorus_ignored_dirs*
g:factorus_ignored_dirs~
defaults: ['.git']

This is the same as |g:factorus_ignored_files|, but with directories.  This is
useful if you have a directory with build files, that might slow down the
program if searched.  NOTE: globbing characters are added to the directories
in the list, i.e. the directory '.git' becomes '*/.git/*'.  Thus, if you have
two directories, one with the path '/home/factorus/project/ignore' and one
with the path '/home/factorus/project/do/not/ignore', all files in both of
these directories will be ignored. If you need greater specificity, use a
full path to the directory. As with |g:factorus_ignored_files|, any user-defined
value will be appended to the default, rather than replacing it.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_ignored_dirs = ['WEB-INF']
>

                                                 *g:factorus_method_threshold*
g:factorus_method_threshold~
Default: 0.9

The maximum allowable ratio of the number of lines of an extracted method to
the number of the lines of the old method when using |:FExtractMethod|. This 
is to prevent over-extraction (for instance, if the algorithm selects all but
the return statement).

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_method_threshold = 0.8
<

                                                *g:factorus_extract_heuristic*
g:factorus_extract_heuristic~
Default: 'longest'

This determines how |:FExtractMethod| decides what to extract from a method.
If this is set to 'longest', the function uses the largest block of independent
statements.  If this is set to 'greedy', the function uses the first block of
independent statements.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_extract_heuristic = 'greedy'
<

                                                      *g:factorus_split_lines*
g:factorus_split_lines~
Default: 1

If this equals 1, then |:FExtractMethod| will split a method declaration across
multiple lines if the declaration is longer than |g:factorus_split_lines|.
Otherwise, the declaration will be put onto a single line.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_split_lines = 0
<

                                                      *g:factorus_line_length*
g:factorus_line_length~
Default: 125

If |g:factorus_split_lines| is 1, this determines the length at which a method
declaration is split.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_line_length = 150
<

                                                     *g:factorus_show_changes*
g:factorus_show_changes~
Default: 1

The behavior of |:FRenameMethod| changes based on the value of this variable.
If
    |g:factorus_show_changes| == 0:
        The quickfix list is not updated after a rename.
    |g:factorus_show_changes| == 1:
        The quickfix list is set to a list of all changes made, 
    |g:factorus_show_changes| == 2:
        The quickfix list is set to a list of all changes NOT made, to 
        values with the same pattern as what was updated.  This option is 
        useful to check if |:FRenameMethod| made any changes that shouldn't 
        have been made.

If |g:factorus_show_changes| > 0, the quickfix list will show the file, the
line number, and the line text. The quickfix list will show the line as it 
was before the change, not after.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_show_changes = 1
<

                                                    *g:factorus_build_program*
g:factorus_build_program~
Default: 'make'

Determines the build program used for building the project.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_build_program = 'gradle'
<

                                                       *g:factorus_build_task*
g:factorus_build_task~
Default: ''

Determines the default task called when building the project.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_build_task = 'build-war'
<

                                                       *g:factorus_build_file*
g:factorus_build_file~
Default: ''

Determines the build file Factorus looks for when building the project. If
this is not provided, the default build file for |g:factorus_build_program|
will be used (i.e., build.xml for ant). If you wish to specify an absolute
path to the build file, be sure not to use any aliases in the path (i.e, use 
'/home/USERNAME' instead of '~').

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_build_file = 'custom.xml'
<

                                                    *g:factorus_build_options*
g:factorus_build_options~
Default: ''

Use this to specify any command-line arguments to pass to |g:factorus_build_program|.
Add all arguments as a space-separated string.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_build_options = '-Dbuild_env=PROD'
<

                                                         *g:factorus_validate*
g:factorus_validate~
Default: 0

If set to 1, Factorus will rebuild the project after every command, in order
to validate the changes.  If set to 0, you can still validate the current
state of the project by running |:FRebuild|.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_validate = 1
<

                                                     *g:factorus_default_lang*
g:factorus_default_lang~
Default: ''

Used to distinguish which language to use in the case of ambigious file 
extensions (.h in particular).  This option is really only useful when
working in C, as the default filetype when editing header files is C++.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_default_lang = 'c'
<

                                                      *g:factorus_add_default*
g:factorus_add_default~
Default: 0

If 1, then |:FAddParam| changes the signature of the function, as well as the
declaration. This means that all function calls will be given a default
argument, which can be specified as an argument (if left out, the default
argument is just 'null').  If 0, only the declaration is changed.

Example:
>
        let g:factorus_add_default = 1
<
